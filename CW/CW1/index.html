  In this era, we talk to phones, not talk to others through our phones. 
  The world is moving towards digitization where are programs are becoming  
  human like Cortana and Siri. The world is transforming towards the usage 
  of Virtual Digital Assistants, which can come in many forms. The Virtual 
  Digital Assistants are automated tools which help the human through their
  voice commands or through their written words (Natural Language Processing).
  This assistance can be offered in many ways, such as, enabling the most 
  recently visited links on enterprise websites or to make a conversational
  speech based interaction in order to facilitate basic necessities like reading
  out the messages, emails on your smart phone such as Cortana, Siri, Google now.

  VDAs represent the fusion of recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and hold the potential to have a transformative impact
  on user interfaces in the mobile, automotive, connected home, and enterprise domains,
  among others.

  Virtual Assistant Technology is not just about setting up an avatar. 
  Can Virtual Assistance pick up the phone, chat on instant messenger, 
  update Facebook or send a text using SMS?  The Natural Language Interaction 
  technology that drives the Virtual Assistants from Artificial Solutions 
  can be applied to multiple customer service touch points, from SMS, 
  and instant messaging, through understanding and responding the sentiment on 
  social media to using voice integration to handle telephone calls.
